 * 
 * The goal of this script is to provide a shared library of functions
 * available to all RPGmaster APIs (and anyone else who wants to use them)
 * 
 * v0.1.0  28/03/2022 Initial version.
 * v0.2.1  08/04/2022 Initial RollTemplate parser.  Fixed checkCSdb() to create
 *                    ct- attributes for non-spec-ed abilities in a database.
 * v0.2.2  10/04/2022 Enhanced RollTemplate parser with image mgt & result display.
 *                    Updated doDisplayAbility() to additionally display non-db 
 *                    abilities (e.g. saving throws & attacks).
 * v0.2.3  01/05/2022 Added wider variety of RPGM templates for future expansion.
 *                    Extracted save calcs from functional APIs to lib to support
 *                    game specific save calcs.  Added ring/hand management.
 * v0.2.4  16/05/2022 Added output configuration button to all templates.
 * v0.2.5  17/05/2022 Intercept chat messages with &{template:RPGM.*?} and parse them
 * v0.2.6  14/07/2022 Removed whisper commands from database entries as now directed
 *                    to correct player programmatically
 * v0.2.7  18/07/2022 Changed DBindex and abilityLookup() to point to DBnames[] array
 *                    for ability definitions unless they exist in char sheet DBs
 * v1.3.00 21/09/2022 First release to GitHub. Updated to delete old versions of 
 *                    standard character sheet databases.
 * v1.3.01 01/10/2022 Fix issue with database lookup if a character has a name that 
 *                    includes "spell" or "power" in their name. Added support for 
 *                    direct access to MU & PR spells, and/or other Magic Items as 
 *                    powers for characters and magic items.
 * v1.3.02 10/10/2022 Fixed errors in the coding of spells that requite a To-Hit roll 
 *                    but do damage rather than targeted magic. Changed initiative 
 *                    modifier char sheet field from comreact to custom field init-mod. 
 *                    Added spell as weapon flag to spell tables. Extended Ability 
 *                    object with new methods .data() & .hands().
 * v1.3.03 22/10/2022 Support for the Race Database.
 * v1.3.04 15/11/2022 Allow handleCheckSaves() to work in silent mode. Added support 
 *                    for the Creatures database.
 * v1.4.01 28/11/2022 Support for the Fighting Styles database & creature setup. Allow
 *                    alphabetically indexed lists. Support %{DB|abilityMacro} in 
 *                    certain database definitions (e.g. Race/Creature). ShapeSpellbook()
 *                    moved to library. Extended String prototype with dbName() method.
 *                    Updated Attacks-DB with Throat Leech attacks. Added more creatures.
 *                    Adds and fixes to other database entries. Added deeper inheritance
 *                    chaining for race and class definitions.
 * v1.4.02 16/12/2022 More creature definitions, and supporting powers. Add ability to
 *                    specify weapons and armour for creatures with probability of
 *                    different sets. Also added ammo reuse type 2: becomes only possible
 *                    ammo of several for that weapon e.g. spitting snake venom, and
 *                    type 3: reduces in qty by 1, and all other ammo for same weapon
 *                    increases qty b 1.
 * v1.4.03 16/01/2023 Added Attack messages (similar to damage messages) using Ranged 
 *                    weapons notes field. Added ability for creature innate attacks to 
 *                    have damage roll before attack name so they work with CS buttons.
 *                    Fixed issue with abilityLookup() if ability name undefined.
 *                    Fixed issue with resolveData() if not defaulting values & ns: 
 *                    attribute not specified.

	 * The fields object defines all the fields on a character sheet that the
	 * API uses.  These can be changed by the user **with caution**
	 * DO NOT change the name of each line in the object - this is what the API
	 * uses to find the name of the fields you want on the character sheet.
	 * ONLY CHANGE definitions within the '[...]' brackets.  Before the comma is
	 * the name of the field on the character sheet, and after the comma is the
	 * property used in the attribute object with that name.
	 * For REPEATING TABLE LINES: the table reference is in a definition named '..._table:'
	 * and consists of the reference name before the comma, and a flag defining if the
	 * first row of the table is the 'repeating_..._$0_' line (true) or a static field (false).
	 * Values in the table are then defined as separate definitions below the table
	 * reference definition e.g. 
	 *     MW_table: ['repeating_weapons',false],
	 *     MW_name:  ['weaponname','current'],
	 *     MW_speed: ['weapspeed','current'],
	 * means the MW (Melee Weapons) table has the following structure:
	 *     1st row:  weaponname.current, weapspeed.current
	 *     2nd row:  repeating_weapons_$0_weaponname.current, repeating_weapons_$0_weapspeed.current
	 *     3rd row:  repeating_weapons_$1_weaponname.current, repeating_weapons_$1_weapspeed.current

A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round.

That\'s what Style Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less specialized training in the weapon.}}{{desc4=**One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed**\nSome players don\'t realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used two-handed. If you specialize in Two-Hander Style and then use a one-handed weapon in two\nhands, you also get a bonus of +1 to damage. The one-handed weapons which can be used two-handed in this fashion include: Battle axe, Club, Footman\'s flail, Footman\'s pick, Horseman\'s flail, Horseman\'s mace, Horseman\'s pick, Morning star, Long sword, Warhammer.}}'},

First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.\nWhen fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty. \nThough rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style.

They patrol the deeps of oceans and large inland waters, holding court beneath the waves. Often they are only seen when they frolic with dolphins in kelp beds.\nAquatic elves have gill slits much like fish, through which they process oxygen. They can also survive out of water for a short time by breathing. Their skin is typically silvergreen, matching the seaweed near their territory. Some possess a bluish tinge to their skin, although this is quite rare. Aquatic elves\' hair complements their skin and is also green or blue-green. The overall effect is one that makes them difficult to discern underwater, especially near kelp beds. Because of their coloring, they gain the typical elven ability to camouflage themselves in their natural environment. \nThese elves dislike sharks intensely. Because they fear the strange and terrible monsters that dwell in the sea, the aquatic elves and the dolphins have taken it upon themselves to keep at least some of it safe for those who travel across it. Thus, most seaside communities severely punish those who incur the wrath of sea elves. Only the most evil of people encourage the death of sea elves and dolphins.\nAlthough they may survive on land, aquatic elves prefer not to do so, for it causes them immense pain. They can walk on land for a number of days equal to their initial Constitution score. Every two days, all their ability scores decrease by –1 until the elves return to water. If a physical score (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) reaches 0, the elf dies. In salt water, the sea elf\'s attributes return to normal within 15 minutes. In fresh water, an elf merely stops losing his or her scores; they do not revert to normal until the elf enters salt water.}}'},

In truth, they are no more evil than their more numerous cousins; their sinister reputation is merely the result of ignorance. The Deep Gnomes are the most reticent of all the gnomish subraces, surviving in an extremely hostile environment entirely by their own wiles.\nUnlike their Rock Gnome cousins, they have no friendly neighbors to ally themselves with, forcing them to become entirely selfreliant. Only the few who have won their trust know that they are in many ways as social and artistic as other gnomes.\nWhy do they endure this frankly hostile environment? The answer is simple: they are drawn by the lure of gemstones, which is more pronounced in the Deep Gnomes than in\nany other subrace. The gem that most draws the interest and devotion of the Svirfneblin is the ruby, which is the predominant symbol of the race. The Deep Gnomes view these crimson stones with reverence approaching awe--so much so that they are never used for mundane practices such as ornamentation of garments, weapons, or armor. Rubies are reserved for sacred purposes and are often employed to decorate artifacts that are dedicated to the Svirfneblin gods. They are also favored by Deep Gnome monarchs, so much so that a Svirfneblin king or queen might have a full ring of rubies around his or her crown, with others of the precious stone set in the throne and sceptre.\nDeep Gnomes make and wield *stun darts*, throwing them to a range of 40 feet, with a +2 bonus to hit.

Even though elves tend toward haughtiness and arrogance at times, they regard their friends and associates as equals. They do not make friends easily, but a friend (or enemy) is never forgotten. They prefer to distance themselves from humans, have little love for dwarves, and hate the evil denizens of the woods.\nWhile they find well-wrought jewelry a pleasure to behold, they are not overly interested in money or gain. They find magic and swordplay (or any refined combat art) fascinating. If they have a weakness it lies in these interests.}}'},

They dwell in large swaths of woodland, and--unlike the other gnomish subraces - prefer to dwell in houses that are at least partially above ground. They are creatures of nature far more than any of their cousins, and to those rare folks who meet them (and pass through the walls of initial shyness) they can prove to be steadfast allies and delightful companions.\nHowever, this subrace has not totally abandoned the love of gemstones that is so inherent to all gnomes. The emerald is the favored gem of the Forest Gnomes, no doubt because it most accurately reflects the healthy colors of their verdant homelands. While these gnomes can make excellent gemsmiths and jewelers, their work tends to be reverent images of the flowers, leaves, butterflies, and birds that are such a key part of the Forest Gnome\'s environment.\nThey share the stocky physique of the Rock and Tinker Gnome and the bulbous nose which is so characteristic of the race in general. They are the only gnomes inclined to wear beards and hair very long, and an older male is likely to have a beard that extends to within a few inches of the ground, and hair that, when unbound, falls all the way to his waist. These beards are a source of great pride to the venerable males, and they often trim them to a fine point or curl them into hornlike spikes that extend to either side.\nShy and timid when it comes to relations with other intelligent races, Forest Gnomes are very determined caretakers of their wooded domains. They are viewed with friendship by the animals of the forest and have developed a limited language of signs and sounds (similar to the Rock Gnome\'s \'speech\' with burrowing mammals) that allows them to communicate with these creatures, though without a great deal of detail.\nForest Gnomes are also very adept at protecting and caring for the plant life of their woods. They gather the nuts, fruit, and other bounty of the woods for sustenance, taking meat only infrequently--and always with a reverent ceremony to the spirit of the animal slain by the gnomish hunter. They despise the use of traps, never employing snares, pitfalls, or such traps themselves. When they encounter such devices set by humans or others, the Forest Gnomes have been known to rig the traps so that they capture (with a snare) or injure (as with a deadfall or pit trap) the trapper when he or she comes along to check for game. Generally, the trapper receives the same effect that his or her trap would have inflicted upon an animal.\nAside from meat, Forest Gnomes eat their food raw, though with a great deal of ceremony and politeness. Even a nut or a berry is only consumed after the tree or bush that gave it life has been properly, albeit silently, thanked. Needless to say, meals among the Forest Gnomes are very long, quiet affairs.\nThe most hated enemies of the Forest Gnomes are orcs, with troglodytes and lizardmen close behind. These creatures will be ruthlessly attacked and ambushed whenever they are encountered. Despite their shyness, Forest Gnomes have made friends with elves and halflings, though they tend to distrust humans and dwarves, who in their experience all-too-often view trees only as so much firewood.}}'},

They live in abandoned strongholds, human villages, or in old mines and caves, in sewers, refuse dumps, or the slums of larger towns and cities. Elves will not tolerate their depravity.\nAn average gully dwarf is more slender than hill or mountain dwarves and has thin fingers. It is a status symbol for a gully dwarf to have a large pot belly for it displays his skill as a scavenger.\nSkin ranges in color from olive brown to light yellow, reminiscent of old parchment. It is often hard to determine a gully dwarf\'s skin color, however, because of the thick layers of dirt, scar tissue, boils, and scabs covering his skin.\nTheir beards and hair range from a dirty blond to a dull, indeterminate color. Female gully dwarves have hairy cheeks, but no beards. The eyes of both sexes are dull and lifeless, varying in color from watery blue through green to hazel.\nGullys are renowned for being stupid and obnoxious. A player character gully dwarf is an exception to the rule, being superior to others of his kind by virtue of his ability to think. However, players should not abuse this ability and allow their characters to concoct clever plans and schemes. Intelligence checks may be requested to see if the character could actually come up with such ideas. \nThey have high opinions of themselves and take themselves very seriously. They consider other dwarves to be "uppity" and "stuck up warts." Gully dwarves will lie, steal, bully, and cheat each other and every other race they encounter. If attacked, they grovel (see the power), whine, run away, or do whatever it takes to avoid injury. If combat cannot be avoided they will fight halfheartedly, usually with their eyes closed.\nBecause gully dwarves live in places that even orcs consider unattractive, they have few racial enemies. Scavenging most of their equipment from the junk heaps of other races, their "wealth" does not tempt others. Carrion crawlers have been known to turn up their tentacles rather than eat a gully dwarf.\nWhere do they come from? Other dwarves claim they are a cruel jest played by the gods on a mischievous stronghold of dwarves. Narvil believes that they are outcasts from a stronghold who later bred and infested the world. Perhaps they are the result of cross breeding between dwarves and gnomes, or dwarves and goblins. They may even have been the result of a vile experiment by an evil wizard. No one knows for sure, least of all the gullys themselves.\nThey are always treated with contempt, although they may be employed to perform menial tasks. Enclaves of gully dwarves could exist in most strongholds where they would be little better than slaves.\nGully dwarves are often of chaotic neutral alignment, but this diverse people may be of any alignment.}}'},

Their lives are geared toward the simple matter of survival in the woodlands, rather than enjoyment. Yet sylvan elves find that this life, more than anything else, gives them their greatest pleasure. Not for them the sophistication of art and delicate music. They prefer a simpler life. Their music is that of wind through leaves, the howl of wolves, and the cries of birds. Their art—in the form of tattoos—is inspired by the everchanging cycle of seasons.\nWood elves, by their very nature, seem more prone to violence than their civilized cousins. Their muscles are larger, their complexions more florid.\nSylvan elves are an independent folk and do not lightly brook intruders into their forests. Anyone, even another elf, who even draws near to a wood elf encampment (within three miles) will have a constant, unseen escort of at least two wood elves (possibly more) until the intruder leaves the area. Unless the camp is directly threatened, the wood elves will leave the intruder strictly alone. Twenty-five percent of the time wood elves will allow trespassers to know that they are being watched.\nIf those encroaching the encampment draw too near and evince hostile intent, the wood elves have no compunctions about utterly destroying them. Wood elves are extraordinarily reclusive—even more so than grey elves. They have no wish to let others expose them or their lifestyle to the harsh scrutiny of the civilized world. Therefore, they may even destroy those who bear the wood elves no particular ill will. They feel this is the only way to ensure their lives and privacy.\nAbove all, wood elves never try to leave their forests. They withdrew into the woods to escape the outer world, and whenever they leave they rediscover why they withdrew in the first place. Wood elves take a dim view of those who try to forcibly remove them. In general, wood elves are unfriendly and unhelpful. Any wood elf PC who is friendly to people he or she has just met (within the past five years or so) should be docked experience points for bad role-playing!\nFinally, wood elves have an aversion to most settings that are not of the woods. They hate the sea (although they can travel on lakes) and will not willingly board a seagoing ship. They hate the underground and become claustrophobic beneath the soil. These elves are even worse in the cities and lands of other races, including those of other elves. Sylvan elves regard cities as a perversion. They cannot deal with technology and civilization, for it was civilization that drove the wood elves into their isolation.}}'},

They make splendid carpenters (often building boats or wagons for human customers), as well as loggers, carvers, pipesmiths, musicians, shepherds, liverymen, dairymen, cheesemakers, hunters, and scouts. They are better farmers than Stouts (although not as good as Hairfeet) and more adept than any other subrace at harvesting natural bounties of berries, nuts, roots, and wild grains.\nThe only halflings who enjoy much proficiency at riding, Tallfellows favor small ponies. Indeed, many unique breeds of diminutive horse have been bred among Tallfellow clans: fast, shaggy-maned, nimble mounts with great endurance. In a charge, of course, they lack the impact of a human-mounted warhorse; nonetheless, Tallfellow companies have served admirably as light lancers and horsearchers during many a hardfought campaign.\nOn foot, Tallfellows wield spears with rare skill. They are adept at forming bristling `porcupine\' formations with these weapons, creating such a menacing array that horses and footmen alike are deterred from attacking. This is one of the few halfling formations capable of standing toe-to-toe with a larger opponent in the open field.}}'},

However, whereas the other subraces seek gems, the Tinkers hold a different substance as the grandest rock of all: coal. The Tinkers hold that coal (also known as the "Father of Steam") is the most valuable substance of the world, and those places where it can be mined quickly become Tinker Gnome warrens.\nIn size and stature, the Tinkers resemble Rock Gnomes--so much so that the difference is not immediately apparent, at least when based only upon appearance.\nTinkers who live out their lives can attain an age of 250 or 300 years, but it must be noted that this is a rare occurrence among the members of this subrace. If one of his or her own inventions doesn\'t do a Tinker in, chances are good that one of his or her neighbor\'s gadgets will.\nEven in childhood, Tinkers are encouraged to experiment with gadgets and gimmicks, trying different means of making things to perform tasks that could otherwise be easily done by hand. The Tinker reaches adulthood at about the age of fifty (by which time perhaps 10-15% of them have already succumbed to the common fate of their kind). Despite this high attrition, it\'s not until maturity that a Tinker Gnome\'s activities begin to get really dangerous.\nUpon reaching adulthood, the Tinker Gnome must select a guild for himself or herself. The number of guilds available varies by location, but in Mount Nevermind on Krynn--which is the center of Tinker civilization and by far the largest community of these inventive creatures anywhere--there are more than 150 active guilds. These include virtually all areas of practical endeavor, and quite a few impractical ones as well.\nAfter selecting a guild, each member of the subrace settles upon a Life-quest. The actual choice of the quest may take several decades, but once it has been decided, it becomes the reason behind that Tinker\'s existence. The Lifequest is an attempt to reach a perfect understanding of some device (anything from a spelljamming helm to a screw), a task at which the Tinker very rarely succeeds. Indeed, the best estimate is that less than 1% of these gnomes ever do fully grasp the nature of the object that has occupied their attention for so much of their adult lives; the rest of these easily-distracted gnomes get hopelessly sidetracked somewhere along the way.\nDespite the vagaries of their existence, the Tinkers are a fun-loving and generally sociable race. Their speech is unique in both its speed and complexity. Two Tinkers can rattle off information and opinion to each other in a succession of thousand-word sentences, speaking simultaneously and yet listening and understanding (as much as is possible, given the esoteric nature of many discussions) each other even as they voice their own points of view. Those Tinkers who have had some experience interacting with other races have learned to slow the pace of their communication but never quite overcome their frustration with those who can\'t talk and listen at the same time.}}'},

In fact, the air elemental\'s mastery of its natural element gives it a strong advantage in combat above the ground. In aerial battles, they gain a +1 to hit and a +4 to the damage they inflict.\nThe most feared power of an air elemental is its ability to form a whirlwind upon command. Using this form, the air elemental appears as a truncated, reversed cone. It takes one\nfull turn to form and dissipate this cone.

A save versus paralyzation is allowed to escape these effects. They kill paralyzed creatures with their bite which inflicts 1-2 points of damage. The monster will always attack with all of its tentacles.\nCarrion crawlers are non-intelligent, and will continue to attack as long as any of their opponents are unparalyzed. Groups of crawlers attacking together will not fight in unison, but will each concentrate on paralyzing as many victims as they can. When seeking out prey, they rely primarily on their keen senses of sight and smell.

The oak trees of dryads do not radiate magic, but someone finding a dryad\'s home has great power over her. A dryad suffers damage for any damage inflicted upon her home tree. Any attack on a dryad\'s tree will, of course, bring on a frenzied defense by the dryad.}}Specs=[Dryad,CreatureRace,0H,Creature]{{Section9=**Description**}}{{desc8=Dryads are beautiful, intelligent tree sprites. They are as elusive as they are alluring, however, and dryads are rarely seen unless taken by surprise - or they wish to be spotted.\nThe dryad\'s exquisite features, delicate and finely chiseled, are much like an elf maiden\'s. Dryads have high cheek bones and amber, violet, or dark green eyes. A dryad\'s complexion and hair color changes with the seasons, presenting the sprite with natural camouflage. During the fall, a dryad\'s hair turns golden or red, and her skin subtly darkens from its usual light tan to more closely match her hair color.\nThis enables her to blend with the falling leaves of autumn. In winter, both the dryad\'s hair and skin are white, like the snows that cover the oak groves. When encountered in a forest during fall or winter, a dryad is often mistaken for an attractive maid, probably of elvish descent. No one would mistake a dryad for an elf maid during the spring and summer, however. At these times of year, a dryad\'s skin is lightly tanned and her hair is green like the oak leaves around her.\nDryads often appear clothed in a loose, simple garment. The clothing they wear is the color of the oak grove in the season they appear.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Dryads are shy, nonviolent creatures. They rarely carry weapons, but they sometimes carry knives as tools. Though a dryad can use this as a weapon in a fight, she will not resort to using a knife unless seriously threatened.\nDryads have the ability to throw a powerful charm person spell three times a day (but only once per round). This spell is so powerful that targets of the spell suffer a -3 penalty to their saving throws. A Dryad always uses this spell if seriously threatened, attempting to gain control of the attacker who could help her most against his comrades. Dryads will only attempt to charm elves as a last resort because of their natural resistance to this type of spell.\nThe dryad\'s use of her ability to charm is not limited to combat situations, however. Whenever a dryad encounters a male with a Charisma of 16 or more, she usually tries to charm him. Charismatic victims of a dryad\'s attentions are taken to the tree sprite\'s home, where the men serve as amorous slaves to their beautiful captors. There is a 50% chance that a person charmed and taken away by a dryad will never\nreturn. If he does escape from the dryad\'s charms, it will be after 1d4 years of captivity.\nThis tree sprite also has two other powers that are very useful in defense. Unless surprised, a dryad has the ability to literally step through a tree and then dimension door to the oak tree she is part of. She can also speak with plants (as the 4th-level priest spell). This enables the dryad to gather information about parties traveling near her tree, and even to use vegetation to hinder potential attackers.}}'},

Other traps include burying themselves in the sand, in shallow water, and waiting to be stepped on or tangling the rudders of small boats.

In fact the "clothing" is their own saggy skin and pointed heads. The limbs are knottily muscled. The fingernails and toenails are thick and filthy, although the fingers and toes are very nimble. Their gray-brown, warty hide blends in with natural earth and stone.

They avoid directly confronting strong, alert parties, although they may try to injure them out of sheer maliciousness.\nThe jermlaines\' favorite tactic is capturing victims with nets or pits. In little-used passages the creatures prepare pits covered by camouflaged doors or string nets overhead. In more-traveled passages, the jermlaine stretch trip cords. When a victim falls afoul of a trap, the jermlaine swarm over him. Some pummel him with blackjacks while others tie him with ropes and cords. Such beatings have a cumulative 2% chance per blow of causing the victim to lapse into unconsciousness. If a victim is wearing splint, banded, or plate mail, these pummeling attacks are ineffective.

They usually have view ports and murder holes near these traps so that they can pour flaming oil, missile weapons, or drop poisonous insects on their victims.\nKobold war bands are armed with spiked clubs, axes, javelins, short swords and spears.

This blob automatically hits one target within 10 feet of the breathing mephit (1d6 points of damage, no saving throw). A lava mephit may use this weapon a maximum of eight times, after that, the mephit must recharge by soaking in a lava pool for one hour.

This ability is, of course, lost if the mephit is brought to 0 hit points or less, at this point the mephit is dead.

In combat, there is only a 10% chance that a typical ogrillon can be distinguished from an orc. Ogrillons that resemble ogres, of course, clearly stand out.

In general, they resemble primitive humans with grey-green skin covered with coarse hair. Orcs have a slightly stooped posture, a low jutting forehead, and a snout instead of a nose, though comparisons between this facial feature and those of pigs are exaggerated and perhaps unfair. Orcs have well-developed canine teeth for eating meat and short pointed ears that resemble those of a wolf. Orcish snouts and ears have a slightly pink tinge. Their eyes are human, with a reddish tint that sometimes makes them appear to glow red when they reflect dim light sources in near darkness. This is actually part of their optical system, a pigment which gives them infravision.}}{{desc1=**Combat:** Orcs are constantly in battle.

All snakes shed their skin several times each year.\nTypical varieties of poisonous snakes include the asp, cobra, copperhead, coral snake, death adder, krait, mamba, puff adder, rattlesnake, sidewinder, and water moccasin.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** Some cobras and sidewinders hunt by night and can track warmblooded prey by body heat as well as by sight. They have the equivalent of 30-foot infravision. Black mambas are the fastest known snakes and can reach 30 across open ground.\nAll poisonous snakes deliver toxins automatically through their bite.

They are highly organized and greatly enjoy raiding shore communities for food and sport. Typical sahuagins are blackish green on their backs, shading to green on their bellies, with black fins. Their great, staring eyes are deep, shining black. They have scaly skin, with webbed fingers and toes, and their mouths are filled with sharp fangs. About 1 in 216 sahuagin is a mutation with four usable arms. These specimens are usually black shading to gray. Females are indistinguishable from males, except that they are slightly smaller. Hatchlings are a light green color, but they darken and attain full growth approximately one to two months after hatching.}}{{desc9=**Combat:** See attacks above - equip weapons as needed. Spears are used only as thrusting weapons. Nets are set with dozens of hooks that make escape virtually impossible for unarmored victims or creatures not able to grasp and tear with a Strength of 16 or greater. Nets are replaced by three javelins when the band forays onto land. The crossbows fire a maximum of 30 feet underwater and normal ranges on the surface. Tridents have three uses -- to spear small prey, to pin prey trapped in nets, and to hold threatening opponents at bay.\nWhen raiding villages, sahuagin attack en masse, with leaders in the second rank. As long as there is no truly spirited resistance, they continue in their plunder and violence. Underwater, in their natural element, the sahuagin are far more confident. Using the three-dimensional aspect of underwater fighting, they sometimes dive down on a group of underwater explorers, coming in from behind, and swooping down and past them, dropping nets on their intended victims.\nWhen sahuagin attack ships, they swarm up from all sides and try to overwhelm with numbers. They often grab their opponents and hurl them into the sea, where at least a fourth of the raiding party lurks, waiting for such an action or as reinforcements. Some leaders carry a conch shell, which when sounded gives the signal for the group of sahuagin in reserve to enter the fray. \nSahuagin have an almost paralyzing fear of spellcasters. They direct their strongest attacks toward anyone who uses spells or spell-like powers, such as the functions of some magical items.}}'},

Water elementals are also a serious threat to ships that cross their paths. A water elemental can easily overturn small craft (one ton of ship per hit die of the elemental) and stop or slow almost any vessel (one ton of ship per hit point of the elemental). Ships not completely stopped by an elemental will be slowed by a percentage equal to the ratio of ship\'s tons over the hit points of the attacking elemental.\nThough the water elemental is most effective in large areas of open water, it can be called upon to serve in a battle on dry land, close to the body of water from which it arose. However, the movement of the water elemental on land is the most restricted of any elemental type: a water elemental cannot move more than 60 yards away from the water it was conjured from, and 1 point of damage is subtracted from each die of damage they inflict out of the water (to a minimum of 1 point of damage per die)}}'},

They are also great explorers of the sea, and when a priest of the ocean-god decides to hide from other men, only another priest of the same order or an experienced mage can find him in his underwater haven.\nLesser gods will be gods of individual rivers, lakes, and seas.

In addition, after four rounds of melee its wielder can opt to allow it to "dance."\nDancing consists of loosing the staff on any round (after the first) when its bonus is +1. The staff then fights on its own at the same level of experience as its wielder. After four rounds of dancing, the staff returns to its wielder, who must hold it (and use it) for four rounds before it can dance again. When dancing, the staff will leave its owner\'s hand and may go up to [[30]] feet distant. At the end of its fourth round of solo combat, it will move to its possessor\'s hand automatically. Note that when dancing the staff cannot be physically hit, although certain magical attacks such as a fireball, lightning bolt, or transmute metal to wood spell could affect it.\nFinally, remember that the dancing staff fights alone exactly the same; if a 7th-level thief is the wielder, the staff will so fight when dancing. Relieved of his weapon for four melee rounds, the possessor may act in virtually any manner desired—resting, discharging missiles, drawing another weapon and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, etc.—as long as he remains within [[30]] feet of the staff. If he moves more than 30 feet from the weapon, it falls lifeless to the ground and is a +1 weapon when again grasped.}}'},

It has the head of a ram (or a buck goat) as its device. Anyone who attempts a detect magic on the ring discovers an *evocation* upon it.\nThe wearer can cause the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape which resembles the head of a ram or goat.

For instance, a fire giant balanced on a narrow ledge should not gain any benefit from Strength and weight unless he knows that he\'s about to be struck by the force of the ring. This is a case where common sense will serve best.\nIn addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open doors as if a person of 18/00 Strength were doing so. If [two charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-1|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;Two charges expended, so @{selected|token_name}\'s equivalent strength is 19) are expended, the effect is as for a character of 19 Strength, and if [three charges](!magic --mi-charges @{selected|token_id}|-2|Ring-of-the-Ram\\amp#13;Three charges expended, so @{selected|token_name}\'s equivalent strength is 20) are expended, the effect is as if a 20 Strength were used. Magically held or locked portals can be opened in this manner. Structural damage from the ramlike force is identical to an actual battering ram, with double or triple damage accruing for applications of two or three charges. Magical items struck by the ramlike force must save versus crushing blow if three charges are used; otherwise, the force will not affect them. Nonmagical items which are the target of the force save versus crushing blow from the impact.\nA ring of this sort will have from 6 to 10 charges when discovered.

Conjured elementals have 8 Hit Dice.\nIt is possible to conjure successive elementals of different types if the spellcaster has memorised two or more of these spells. The type of elemental to be conjured must be decided upon before memorising the spell. Each type of elemental can be conjured only once per day.\nThe conjured elemental must be controlled by the wizard--the spellcaster must concentrate on the elemental doing his commands--or it turns on the wizard and attacks. The elemental will not break off a combat to do so, but it will avoid creatures while seeking its conjurer. If the wizard is wounded or grappled, his concentration is broken. There is always a 5% chance that the elemental turns on its conjurer regardless of concentration. This check is made at the end of the second and each succeeding round. An elemental that breaks free of its control can be dispelled by the caster, but the chance of success is only 50%. The elemental can be controlled up to 30 yards away per level of the spellcaster.

The deeppockets spell then enables these pockets to hold a total of 100 pounds (5 cubic feet in volume) as if it were only 10 pounds of weight. Furthermore, there are no discernible bulges where the special pockets are. At the time of casting, the caster can instead choose to have 10 pockets each holding 10 pounds (1/2 cubic foot volume each).

Second, it disrupts the casting or use of these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it destroys magical potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).\nEach effect or potion in the spell\'s area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance to dispel depends on the difference in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance is 50% (11 or higher on 1d20 to dispel). If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it more likely that the dispel succeeds); if the caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the number needed on 1d20 to dispel (making it less likely that the dispel succeeds). A roll of 20 always succeeds and a roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled. A dispel magic spell does not affect a specially enchanted item, such as a magical scroll, ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor, unless it is cast directly upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed and carried by a creature gains the creature\'s saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of holding) rendered nonoperational would be temporarily closed. Note that an item\'s physical properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.\nArtifacts and relics are not subject to this spell; however, some of their spell-like effects may be, at the DM\'s option.\nNote that this spell can be very effective when used upon charmed and similarly beguiled creatures.

The mouth cannot speak magical spells or use command words.

Of course, the magic mouth can be placed upon a tree, rock, door, or any other object, excluding intelligent members of the animal or vegetable kingdoms.\nThe spell functions when specific conditions are fulfilled, according to the command of the spellcaster. Some examples are to speak "to the first creature that touches you," or "to the first creature that passes within 30 feet." Commands can be as general or as detailed as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used, such as the following: "Speak only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits crosslegged within 1 foot." Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 6th-level wizard can command the magic mouth to speak at a maximum encounter range of 30 yards ("Speak when a winged creature comes within 30 yards."). The spell lasts until the speak command can be fulfilled; thus, the spell duration is variable. A magic mouth cannot distinguish invisible creatures, alignments, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word.}}'},

The creature has a saving throw penalty of -1 for every two experience levels of the caster, to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Note that a natural (unmodified) roll of 20 automatically succeeds, regardless of saving throw penalties. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Each round after the initial casting, the creature receives another saving throw, without penalty, until it successfully saves and the spell is broken.

Each is a Tome containing 2+1d4 tested and experimental rites and rituals, some of which might work but many of which are disastrous to attempt - there are also always an additional 4+1d8 blank pages. The Tome can only hold and retain rituals to cast MU spells with Casting Times of 2 or more Rounds - though often the rituals will take Turns to perform. If spells of shorter casting times are written into the Tome, they are absorbed into the page and disappear. Each Tome is fireproof (but only gains a save at +4 vs. magical fire) and proof against Dispel Magic, Disintegration and similar magical destruction (other than magical fire). They all have some type of lock on them, most often a magical lock such as a Glyph of Warding but sometimes just a physical lock.\nWizards of any level can use the Tome, and even attempt to perform any of the Rituals therein. Tried and tested Rituals (i.e. to cast defined spells as from the PHB, the Complete Wizard\'s Handbook or the Tome of Magic) can be cast from the Tome with a success rate never greater than 90% minus 5% for each level between the casting MU and the level required to cast the spell. Success means the ritual has the described effect: failure has a chance of summoning an avatar of Math Mathonwy (see AD\\ampD Legends \\amp Lore - Celtic Mythos for details of the avatar), 20% plus 5% per level of the Ritual being performed. The avatar will endeavour to recover the Tome and return immediately to the plane of the Celtic Gods.\nExperimental rituals (researched and devised by the Wizard as per DMG, or by the DM) will have chances of success or failure as determined by the DM and appropriate to the ritual concerned. Failure may incur additional penalties but will always have a chance of an avatar of Math Mathonwy appearing to be determined based on an equivalent level of the ritual as determined by the DM.\nWizards cannot transfer rituals from the Tome into their spell books - for some reason they never seem to transcribe correctly. However, Wizards of any level do not have to do any other check to use the rituals other than described above.}}{{materials=Book}}'},

A user not used to a new form might be penalised at the DM\'s option (for example, -2 penalty to attack rolls) until they practice sufficiently to master it.\nThus, a user changed into an owl could fly, but his vision would be human; a change to a black pudding would enable movement under doors or along halls and ceilings, but not the pudding\'s offensive (acid) or defensive capabilities.

							+'<h1>RPGMaster Release Notes</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for version 1.4.03</i></h6>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>'
							+'<p>A couple of bug fixes for errors in calculating weapon attacks per round, and when using the "Memorise all Powers" funtion for a creature.</p>'
							+'<h3>Creature Innate Attack specification improvements</h3>'
							+'<p>Creature innate attacks, specified using the Attack fields on the Monster tab of the Character Sheet, have always had the ability to specify either just the dice roll for damage, or "Attk name,dice roll,speed,type". However, doing the latter meant the roll button on the Character Sheet did not work, so those using <i>Drag & Drop</i> creatures but not the RPGMaster AttackMaster API experienced issues.</p>'
							+'<p>It is now possible to put either the Attack Name <i>or</i> the Dice Roll first in the sequence (i.e. "Dice Roll,attack name,speed,type" is now also supported). Using this new alternative format means the Character Sheet roll buttons work, and the AttackMaster API will check whether the dice roll specification is in the first or second fields and use whichever is appropriate.</p>'
							+'<h3>Attack & Damage messages</h3>'
							+'<p>The AttackMaster API has supported the addition of messages to Damage Roll notifications as specified in the AttackMaster Help handout for some time. These messages can be added manually to a Character Sheet in the notes field on the Melee Weapons page (tooltip: abilitiesnotes). It is now also possible to add Attack Roll notifications in a similar way by manually adding them to the Character Sheet in the notes field of the Ranged Weapons page (tooltip: abilitiesnotesranged). This message uses exactly the same format as the Damage message.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>Release v1.4.02</h2>'
							+'<h3>Extra Creatures</h3>'
							+'<p>Additional creatures from the AD&D 2e Monsterous Manual have been added to the creature database for DMs to use them when dragging and dropping character tokens.</p>'
							+'<h3>Specify Weapons & Armour for Creatures</h3>'
							+'<p>For humanoid (or non-humanoid) creatures that can wield weapons as specified in the Monsterous Manual, these can now be specified in the Creature Database definitions. Where there are multiple different possible weapon combinations, with percentage chances of each weapon or weapon group, the chance of each can also be specified and will be chosen based on a dice roll made by the API when the creature is dragged and dropped onto the map window.</p>'
							+'<p>It is possible to specify which weapon is in which hand or other limb: prime, offhand, both, or 3rd, 4th, 5th... etc limbs. When equipped, the weapons will automatically be placed in the specified hands ready for battle. It is also possible to specify weapons and ammunition that are in the backpack or quiver. Ammunition used by an equipped ranged weapon will also be automatically made available for use.</p>'
							+'<p>This approach can also be used for armour and shields for creatures.  See the Class & Race Database handout for information.</p>'
							+'<h3>Additional Reusable Ammunition Modes</h3>'
							+'<p>Reusable ammunition modes 0: ordinary recoverable ammo, 1: automatically returning ammo, and -1: breaking ammo already exist.</p>'
							+'<p>There are two new modes.</p>'
							+'<ul>'
								+'<li>2: ammunition that, once used, becomes the only possible ammunition of several types previously available for a particular weapon.</li>'
								+'<li>3: ammunition that, on use, reduces in quantity by 1 (as normal), but all other ammunition for the same weapon increases in quantity by 1, allowing multiple "ammunition modes" to be set up, e.g. as for nets.</li>'

This particular Library supports the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons v2e RPG, and the Advanced D&D 2e Character Sheet by Peter B.</p>'
							+'<p>The functions and data in the Library cannot be accessed directly by the GM or Players (with the exception of the RPGMaster Roll Templates). It does not support any API commands directly, but supports the functioning of the API commands provided by other RPGMaster APIs: <b>InitiativeMaster, AttackMaster, MagicMaster</b> and <b>CommandMaster</b>, to the extent that these APIs will not function without the Library being loaded. <b>Note:</b> RoundMaster does not have any RPG-version specific aspects, is independent of the Library, and does not require a RPGMaster Library to be loaded to function.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library does Roll Template processing for RPGMaster-defined Roll Templates. These can be used by GMs to create their own Chat menus and displays.  See the descriptions in Section 2 for how to access and use these templates.</p>'
							+'<p>The Library also provides a number of objects and functions that can be called from other APIs. These include an extensive Character Sheet table management suite described in Section 3 below, for table structures defined by The Aaron in various standard Roll20 Character Sheets, such as the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet by Peter B. There are a number of other useful functions, which are described in Section 3.</p>'

							+'<h3>2.1 User-Selectable Template Display Options</h3>'
							+'<p>In the API configuration menu, opened using <b>!attk --config</b> or <b>!magic --config</b>, the GM can choose whether the default display of RPGMaster Roll Templates for everyone is <i>Fancy</i>, meaning the system uses background textures and images to make the chat templates look interesting, or <i>Plain</i>, which means the default display is of coloured templates but without textures or images.</p>'
							+'<p>In addition, each Player can choose their own options: at the top right of every menu or message displayed in the chat using a RPGMaster Template is a cog wheel. Clicking this cog wheel will display an options dialog for the Player with three options - Menus with Images, Plain Menus, and Dark Mode Menus. The Player can select one of the options, and the current and all future menus and messages using RPGMaster Roll Templates will be displayed for that particular Player using this new option. The option persists for that Player between gameplay sessions.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> if use of a template includes any of the colour or image field tags (<i>outer image, title image</i> or <i>body image</i>) these images will always appear regardless of which option the Player chooses. The field tags always override the original template definition.</p>'
							+'<h3>2.2 Colour, Padding and Image Override Field Tags</h3>'

							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b><i>forceUpdate:</i></b> (optional) A boolean flag: if true, forces the global database index to be recreated from scratch. If false or not provided, only builds the index if it does not already exist (e.g. when the game session has just started and the APIs initialise)</li>'
							+'</ul><br>'
							+'<pre>dbItemObject = abilityLookup( rootDB, dbItemName, <i>character, silent, default</i> );</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to get an entry from a database. Uses the global DBindex internally to access the correct database entry directly, eliminating the speed of a Roll20 object search. The building of the index using getDBindex() will determine the priority order of the potential sources for database items: see that function description for details. However, if the item does not have an entry in the DBindex (i.e. is not in any currently loaded database), and if a character sheet object is passed as a parameter, this abilityLookup() function will also search the character sheet for a copy of the database item which might have previously been placed there by a getAbility() function call. This allows characters to have items that come from user-defined databases in one campaign that are carried with them to other campaigns which perhaps don\'t have the same user-defined databases loaded.</p>'
							+'<p>Takes the following parameters:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b>rootDB:</b> The root database name for the type of item being recovered. Will access indexes from any database name that starts with the rootDB name. Can be one of <i>MU-Spells-DB, PR-Spells-DB, Powers-DB, MI-DB, Attacks-DB, Class-DB</i></li>'
							+	'<li><b>dbItemName:</b> The name of the item being searched for. The following characters are ignored: \'-\', \'_\', \'space\'.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>character:</i></b> (optional) the character sheet object for the character sheet for which the item is relevant, and which might hold any orphaned item that is not available in current databases.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>silent:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if true, will surpress any error message if the rootDB is invalid or the item cannot be found. False or not provided will result in error messages being returned.</li>'
							+	'<li><b><i>default:</i></b> (optional) a boolean value which, if false, returns < undefined > for any database item object if the item is not found or other errors occur, or if true or not defined returns a default item with the following structure:<br>'
							+		'<pre>{name:\'-\',type:\'\',ct:\'0\',charge:\'uncharged\',cost:\'0\',body:\'This is a blank slot. Go search out something new to fill it up!\'}</pre></li>'
							+	'<li><b>dbItemObject</b> A database item object, of class AbilityObj, with structure:'

							+'</ul><br>'
							+'<pre>dbItemObject = getAbility( rootDB, dbItemName, character, <i>silent</i> )</pre>'
							+'<p>A special version of <i>abilityLookup()</i> that not only gets the requested database item from the databases, but also saves that item to the stated character sheet for later reference. All parameters are defined the same as those for <i>AbilityLookup()</i> above. The returned <i>dbItemObject.dB</i> object attribute always holds the name of the character sheet, so that after a call to <i>getAbility()</i>, the standard Roll20 syntax of `%{${dbItemObject.dB}|${dbItemName}}` will work to display the database item in the chat window, but the original source database information will be lost.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<pre>itemObject = setAbility( character, itemName, itemBody, <i>actionBar</i> )</pre>'
							+'<p>A function to set or update a database item or an ability macro in a character sheet (database items are stored as ability macros on a character sheet). <b>Note:</b> the API in-memory databases cannot be updated in this way. Only items and ability macros on character sheets can be created and updated. Takes the following parameters:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+	'<li><b>character:</b> the character sheet object of the character sheet on which the item is to be stored or updated.</li>'
							+	'<li><b>dbItemName:</b> The name of the item being set. The case of the name and the following characters will be saved as part of the name, but are ignored for indexing and matching of the item name to those already stored on the character sheet: \'-\', \'_\', \'space\'.</li>'

							+'<p>A function to extract an API databse from memory into a Character Sheet Database representation, so that the GM can examine the standard items stored there. <b>Note:</b> the function does not re-index the databases, so the Character Sheet database representation so created will not actually be used to recover data from by the system.

							+'<h2>Character Sheet and Token setup for use with RPGMaster APIs</h2>'
							+'<h3>1. Using APIs to do setup</h3>'
							+'<p>The simplest way to configure a Character Sheet for use with the RPGMaster APIs is to use the functions of the APIs to set up the Character Sheet. If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is installed, a number of features and commands are provided to help the DM/Game Creator in this process.</p>'
							+'<p>The most basic of these is to configure a blank Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Use the [+Add] button on the Roll20 Journal to add a new blank Character Sheet, and Roll20 displays a form to give the sheet a name (or accept with the default provided by Roll20) and optionally an image.</li>'
							+'<li>Select the [Save Changes] button on this form, and then close the blank Character Sheet.</li>'
							+'<li>Drag the newly created Character Sheet onto the map area of the Roll20 UI.</li>'
							+'<li>Switch to the Chat Window, and the <i>Review & Set Race & Classes</i> menu has appeared (scroll down to the bottom if need be).</li>'
							+'<li>If this menu has not appeared, the menu can be opened on the DM\'s Token-Setup button.</li>'
							+'<li>Make sure the token you have just placed on the map area is selected (often it is not).</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Creature type from the Creature drop-down list will automatically setup the Character Sheet and Token to work with the APIs as that creature, setting all necessary fields and setting the Token as the default token for the Character Sheet. At this point the token can immediately be used in play as that creature.</li>'
							+'<li>Selecting a Race and/or Class & level for the Character Sheet will not do as much - the basics will be set, but'
								+'<ul><li>the Character Attributes of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma must be rolled for and added to the sheet manually</li>'
								+'<li>the Token is not linked or set up, as many fields still need to have values set</li>'
								+'<li>use the <i>Token-Setup</i> menu to add Character menu action buttons to the Character Sheet, which provide menu access for Players</li>'
								+'<li>the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup</i> menu can be used to complete setting other aspects of the character before play</li>'
								+'<li>if appropriate, once everything is set up manually make the token the default for the Character Sheet</li></ul>'
							+'<li>Use either the DM\'s <i>Add-Items</i> menu or the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Edit Weapons & Armour</i> menu to add equipment including weapons & armour to Characters and even Creatures that can make use of them.</li>'
							+'<li>Use the Character\'s <i>Attk-Menu / Change Weapons</i> menu to take weapons, shields, and other items in-hand, ready to use in attacks.</li>'
							+'<li>Wizards and Priests can have spells added to their spell books on the DM\'s <i>Token-Setup / Add to Spellbook</i> menu. Then spells can be memorised from the spellbook using the Character\'s <i>Spell-Menu / Memorise Spells</i> menu.</li>'
							+'<li>There are many other features of the APIs that can be used to enhance the Character / NPC being created with Powers, Magic Items and Proficiencies with weapons and Fighting Styles. Explore the other help handouts that come with the APIs for more information.</li></ul>'
							+'<p>Alternatively, the Character Sheet can be set up manually from scratch, or existing Characters with Character Sheets can be adapted for use with the APIs.  This option is explored in the rest of this document. However, adding information (other than Character Attributes) to the Character Sheet manually will never be as functionally rich as using the APIs for setting up the sheet, and in some cases will restrict the operation of the APIs to not work in the optimal way. Always use the API menus where possible.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h3>2. Token configuration</h3>'
							+'<p>The API can work with any Token configuration but requires tokens that are going to participate in API actions to represent a Character Sheet, so that actions relevant to the token and the character it represents can be selected. </p>'
							+'<p>A single Character Sheet can have multiple Tokens representing it, and each of these are able to do individual actions made possible by the data on the Character Sheet jointly represented.  However, if such multi-token Characters / NPCs / creatures are likely to encounter spells that will affect the Character Sheet (such as <i>Haste</i> and <i>Slow</i>) they must be split with each Token representing a separate Character Sheet, or else the one spell will affect all tokens associated with the Character Sheet, whether they were targeted or not!  In fact, <b>it is recommended that tokens and character sheets are 1-to-1 to keep things simple.</b></p>'
							+'<p>The recommended Token Bar assignments for all APIs in the Master Series are:</p>'
							+'<pre>Bar1 (Green Circle):	Armour Class (AC field) - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar2 (Blue Circle):	Base Thac0 (thac0-base field) before adjustments - only current value<br>'
							+'Bar3 (Red Circle):	Hit Points (HP field) - current & max</pre>'
							+'<p>It is recommended to use these assignments, and they are the bar assignments set by the <b>CommandMaster API</b> if its facilities are used to set up the tokens.  However, the APIs will search for the most appropriate fields to use from the token and character sheet - only if the APIs can\'t find valid values will they revert to using these default fields on the token. All tokens must be set the same way, whatever way you eventually choose.</p>'
							+'<p>These default assignments can be changed in each API, by changing the <i>fields</i> object near the top of the <i>RPGMaster Library</i> API script (<b>note:</b> \'bar#\' and \'value\' or \'max\' are separate entries in an array of 2 elements):</p>'
							+'<pre>fields.Token_AC:	defines the token field for the AC value (normally [\'bar1\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxAC:	defines the token field for the AC max (normally [\'bar1\',\'max\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_Thac0:	defines the token field for the Thac0 value (normally [\'bar2\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxThac0: defines the token field for the Thac0 max (normally [\'bar2\',\'max\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_HP:	defines the token field for the HP value (normally [\'bar3\',\'value\'])<br>'
							+'fields.Token_MaxHP:	defines the token field for the HP max (normally [\'bar3\',\'max\'])</pre>'
							+'<p>Alter the bar numbers appropriately or, <b><u><i>if you are not wanting one or more of these assigned</i></u></b>: leave the two elements of the array as [\'\',\'\'].  The system will generally work fine with reassignment or no assignment, but not always, especially if Effect Macros are programmed with hard-coded field assignments rather than using ^^field-tag^^ redirects <i>(see RoundMaster API documentation for information on Effect Macros)</i>.</p>'
							+'<h3>3. Use with various game system character sheets</h3>'
							+'<p>The latest version of the RPGMaster series APIs use various game and character sheet-specific versions the <b>RPGMaster Library</b> to implement the relevant rules, parameters and databases specific to a game-version and/or Roll20 character sheet version.  Loading the correct RPGMaster Library will configure all the RPGMaster APIs to work with that game rule set and character sheet. <b>However:</b> at the time of writing, only the AD&D 2E game version, and Advanced D&D 2E Character Sheet by Peter B. are supported.</p>'
							+'<h3>4. Matching the API to a type of Character Sheet</h3>'
							+'<p>As with other game and character sheet specific configuration, selecting the correct RPGMaster Library will configure the RPGMaster APIs for the character sheet in use.  If a character sheet does not have the fields specified in the Library, the RPGMaster APIs will create them - it can, in fact, work with a totally blank character sheet definition and it will create all of the fields it requires from scratch: it just won\'t look very pretty or be very usable as a character sheet! However, you can alter the Library to work with any character sheet as follows (though the game rules and databases will remain those coded in that version of the Library).</p>'
							+'<p>The Library API has an object definition called \'fields\', which contains items of the form </p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_name: [sheet_field_name, field_attribute, optional_default_value, optional_set_with_worker_flag]</pre>'
							+'<p>A typical example might be:</p>'
							+'<pre>Fighter_level:[\'level-class1\',\'current\'],<br>'
							+'Or<br>'
							+'MUSpellNo_memable:[\'spell-level-castable\',\'current\',\'\',true],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_name</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_field_name</i> and <i>field_attribute</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Table names are slightly different: always have an <i>internal_api_name</i> ending in \'_table\' and their definition specifies the repeating table name and the index of the starting row of the table or -1 for a static field as the 1<sup>st</sup> row.</p>'
							+'<pre>Internal_api_table: [sheet_repeating_table_name,starting_index]</pre>'
							+'<p>An example is:</p>'
							+'<pre>MW_table:[\'repeating_weapons\',0],</pre>'
							+'<p>The <i>internal_api_table</i> <b><u>must not be altered!</b></u> Doing so will cause the system not to work.  However, the <i>sheet_repeating_table_name</i> and <i>starting_index</i> can be altered to match any character sheet.</p>'
							+'<p>Each character sheet must have repeating tables to hold weapons, ammo and magic items, as well as other data (if it does not, or they are not the ones specified in the <i>fields</i> object, the APIs will create them).  By default, melee weapons \'in hand\' are held in sections of the repeating_weapons table, melee weapon damage in the repeating_weapons-damage table, ranged weapons in the repeating_weapons2 table, ammo in the repeating_ammo table, and magic items are held in the repeating_potions table.  The table management system provided by the API expands and writes to repeating attributes automatically, and the DM & Players do not need to worry about altering or updating any of these tables on the Character Sheet. If the Character Sheet does not have tables to display any specific table, the APIs will create the table and attach it to the sheet and will be able to use it, but the Players and DM will not see the content except through the API menus and dialogues.</p>'
							+'<h3>5. Character Attributes, Races, Classes and Levels</h3>'
							+'<p>Character Attributes of <i>Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom</i> and <i>Charisma</i> are generally not directly important to the RPGMaster Series APIs, but the resulting bonuses and penalties are.  All Attributes and resulting modifiers should be entered into the Character Sheet in the appropriate places (that is in the Character Sheet fields identified in the \'fields\' API object as noted in section 2 above).</p>'
							+'<p>The Character\'s race is also important for calculating saves and ability to use certain items.  The race should be set in the appropriate Character Sheet field.  Currently, the races <i>\'dwarf\', \'elf\', \'gnome\', \'halfelf\', \'halfling\', \'half-orc\'</i> and <i>\'human\'</i> are implemented (not case sensitive, and spaces, hyphens and underscores are ignored).  If not specified, <i>human</i> is assumed.  The race impacts saves, some magic items and armour, and bonuses on some attacks.</p>'
							+'<p>The system supports single-class and multi-class characters.  Classes must be entered in the appropriate fields on the Character Sheet - if using the <b>CommandMaster API</b>, the --abilities or --class-menu commands can be used to set the classes and levels of characters and NPCs.  Classes and levels affect spell casting ability, ability to do two-weapon attacks with or without penalty, and the ability to backstab and the related modifiers, among other things.  Class and level also determine valid weapons, armour, shields, some magic items and saves.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> the appropriate fields must be used for relevant classes - this varies by character sheet.  E.g. on the Advanced D&D 2e Character Sheet, Fighter classes must be in the first class column, Wizard classes in the second column, Priest classes in the third, Rogues in the fourth, and Psions (or any others) in the fifth.  If manually adding classes, it is important that these locations are adhered to.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> classes of Fighter and Rogue (such as Rangers and Bards) that can use clerical &/or wizard spells will automatically be allowed to cast spells once they reach the appropriate level by the specific game version rules, but not before.  They <b><u>do not</b></u> need to have levels set in the corresponding spell-caster columns - the casting ability & level is worked out by the system</p>'
							+'<p>The Class-DB database holds definitions of the classes and class rules distributed with the system.  If the MagicMaster API is loaded, use the !magic --extract-db Class-DB command to extract the database to a character sheet to examine and update the class rules.  Examples of Classes currently supported are:</p>'
							+'<table><thead><tr><td>Fighter classes</td><td>Wizard Classes</td><td>Priest Classes</td><td>Rogue Classes</td></tr></thead>'
							+'<tr><td>Warrior</td><td>Wizard</td><td>Priest</td><td>Rogue</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Fighter</td><td>Mage</td><td>Cleric</td><td>Thief</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ranger</td><td>Abjurer</td><td>Druid</td><td>Bard</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Paladin</td><td>Conjurer</td><td>Healer</td><td>Assassin</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Beastmaster</td><td>Diviner</td><td>Priest of Life</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Barbarian</td><td>Enchanter</td><td>Priest of War	</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Defender (Dwarven)</td><td>Illusionist</td><td>Priest of Light</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Invoker</td><td>Priest of Knowledge</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Necromancer</td><td>Shaman</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td> </td><td>Transmuter</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p>The level for each class must be entered in the corresponding field.  Multiple classes and levels can be entered, and will be dealt with accordingly.  Generally, the most beneficial outcome for any combination will be used.  </p>'
							+'<h3>6. Magic Items and Equipment</h3>'
							+'<p>All magic items and standard equipment, including weapons, armour, lanterns etc, are held in the Items table, which by default is set to the potions table, <i>repeating_potions</i>, on the Character Sheet.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  The best way to put items into this table is by using the <b>MagicMaster API</b> commands <b>--edit-mi</b> or the GM-only command <b>--gm-edit-mi</b>.  Alternatively, the <b>AttackMaster --edit-weapons</b> command can be used to load weapons, ammunition and armour into the Items table.  It is generally possible to enter item names and quantities directly into the table and use them within the system, but only items that also exist in the supplied databases will actually work fully with the API (i.e. be recognised by the API as weapons, armour, ammo, etc).  Other items can be in the table but will not otherwise be effective.</p>'
							+'<p>Items can be added to the databases.  See the Database Handouts for more information on the databases.</p>'
							+'<h3>7. Weapons and Ammo</h3>'
							+'<p>For the APIs to work fully the melee weapons, damage, ranged weapons and ammo must be selected using the <b>AttackMaster --weapon</b> command to take the weapon \'in hand\'.  This will display a menu to take weapons and shields from the Items table and take them in hand, ready to use.  This automatically fills all the correct fields for the weapons and ammo to make attacks, including many fields that are not displayed.  Entering weapon data directly into the melee weapon, damage, ranged weapon and ammo tables will generally work, but will be overwritten if the --weapon command is used.  Also, some API functions may not work as well or at all.</p>'
							+'<p>For the <b>InitiativeMaster API</b> to support weapon attack actions weapon name, speed and number of attacks are the most important fields.  For the <b>AttackMaster API</b> to support attack rolls, proficiency calculations, ranged attacks, strength and dexterity bonuses, and other aspects of functionality, fill in as many fields as are visible on the character sheet.  When entering data manually, ensure that the row a melee or ranged weapon is in matches the row damage or ammo is entered in the respective tables (there is no need to do this if using AttackMaster functions to take weapons in-hand, as the relevant lines are otherwise linked).</p>'
							+'<h3>8. Weapon Proficiencies</h3>'
							+'<p>Weapon Proficiencies must be set on the Character Sheet.  This is best done by using the <b>CommandMaster API</b> character sheet management functions, but can be done manually.  Both specific weapons and related weapon groups can be entered in the table, and when a Player changes the character\'s weapons in-hand the table of proficiencies will be consulted to set the correct bonuses and penalties.  Weapon specialisation and mastery (otherwise known as double specialisation) are supported by the CommandMaster functions, but can also be set by ticking/selecting the relevant fields on the Character Sheet weapon proficiencies table.  If a weapon or its related weapon group does not appear in the list, it will be assumed to be not proficient.</p>'
							+'<h3>8. Spell books and memorisable spells</h3>'
							+'<p>The best (and easiest) way to give a Character or NPC spells and powers is to use <b>CommandMaster API</b> to add spells and powers to the Character\'s spellbooks, and <b>MagicMaster API</b> to memorise and cast spells and use powers.  However, for the purposes of just doing initiative and selecting which spell to cast in the next round, the spells and powers can be entered manually onto the character sheet.  Spells are held in the relevant section of the Spells table, which by default is set to the character sheet spells table, <i>repeating_spells</i>.  As with other fields, this can be changed in the <i>\'fields\'</i> object.  Note that on the Advanced D&D 2e character sheet Wizard spells, Priest spells & Powers are all stored in various parts of this one very large table.</p>'
							+'<p>If you are just using the character sheet fields to type into, add spells (or powers) to the relevant "Spells Memorised" section (using the [+Add] buttons to add more as required) <b>a complete row at a time</b> (that is add columns before starting the next row).  Enter the spell names into the "Spell Name" field, and "1" into each of the "current" & "maximum" "Cast Today" fields - the API suite <i>counts down</i> to zero on using a spell, so in order for a spell to appear as available (not greyed out) on the initiative menus, the "current" number left must be > 0.  This makes spells consistent with other tables in the system (e.g. potion dose quantities also count down as they are consumed, etc).</p>'
							+'<p>Then, you need to set the "Spell Slots" values on each level of spell to be correct for the level of caster.  Just enter numbers into each of the "Level", "Misc." and "Wisdom" (for Priests) fields, and/or tick "Specialist" for the Wizard levels as relevant.  This will determine the maximum number of spells memorised each day, that will appear in the spells Initiative Menu.  Do the same for Powers using the "Powers Available" field.  As with other fields on the character sheet, each of these fields can be re-mapped by altering the <i>\'fields\'</i> object in the <i>RPGMaster Library</i> API.</p>'
							+'<p>Spells can only be cast if they have macros defined in the spell databases (see Spell Database Handout).  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spell books and granted powers from the provided spell & power databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The spells a spell caster can memorise (what they have in their spell books, or what their god has granted to them) is held as a list of spell names separated by vertical bars \'|\' in the character sheet attribute defined in <i>fields.Spellbook</i> (on the AD&D2E character sheet \'spellmem\') of each level of spell.  On the AD&D2E sheet, the spell books are the large Spell Book text fields at the bottom of each spell level tab.  The spell names used must be identical (though not case sensitive) to the spell ability macro names in the spell databases (hence the hyphens in the names).   So, for example, a 1<sup>st</sup> level Wizard might have the following in their large Wizard Level 1 spell book field:</p>'
							+'<pre>Armour|Burning-Hands|Charm-Person|Comprehend-Languages|Detect-Magic|Feather-fall|Grease|Identify|Light|Magic-Missile|Read-Magic|Sleep</pre>'
							+'<p>Only these spells will be listed as ones they can memorise at level 1.  When they learn new spells and put them in their spell book, this string can be added to just by typing into it.  When they reach 3<sup>rd</sup> level and can have 2<sup>nd</sup> level spells, the following string might be put in the spell book on the Level 2 Wizard spells tab:</p>'
							+'<pre>Alter-Self|Invisibility|Melfs-Acid-Arrow|Mirror-Image|Ray-of-Enfeeblement</pre>'
							+'<p>Again, as they learn more spells and put them in their spell book, just edit the text to add the spells.</p>'
							+'<p>Once these spell books are defined, the DM or Player can use the <b>MagicMaster --mem-spell</b> command (or an action button and associated ability macro on the Character Sheet) to memorise the correct number of these spells in any combination and store those on the Character Sheet.</p>'
							+'<h3>9. Powers</h3>'
							+'<p>Powers are defined in the Powers database - see Database handouts - though it is possible to use Wizard or Priest spells as powers.  If the <b>CommandMaster API</b> is also loaded, the DM can use the tools provided there to manage Character, NPC & creature spellbooks and granted powers.</p>'
							+'<p>Powers work in an almost identical way to Wizard & Priest spells, except that there is only 1 level of powers.  Powers that the character has are added to the spell book on the Powers tab in the same way as spells, and then memorised using the <b>--mem-spell</b> command (which also works for powers with the right parameters).  If you want to add Wizard or Priest spells as powers that can be used one or more times a day, or at will, the <b>CommandMaster</b> token setup  spellbook function allows spells to be added to the powers spellbook. Otherwise, just add the name of the spell with a prefix of "MU-" or "PR-" manually to the powers spellbook e.g. to add a Wizard Light spell as a power, add it to the powers spellbook as "MU-Light". Spells added in this way can be memorised as powers in exactly the same way as other powers.</p>'

							+'<h1>Weapon and Armour Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for AttackMaster v'+version+'</i> and later</h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining weapons, ammo, and items of armour and their specifications, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Weapons:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Weapons-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Ammo:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Ammo-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'<tr><td>Armour:</td><td>additional databases: MI-DB-Armour-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the weapon, ammo or armour specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item.</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMweapon, RPGMammo, and RPGMarmour</i> are the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a weapon, ammunition or piece of armour, the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Weapons</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any item provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Weapon & Ammunition Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Weapon databases are all character sheets that have names that start with MI-DB-Weapon (though in fact, weapons can be in any database starting with MI-DB- if desired), and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.  Ammunition databases are similar, with the root database MI-DB-Ammo.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each weapon definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the weapon, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other weapons, and sometimes Attributes defining powers given by, or spells stored on the item. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new weapons does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>AttackMaster</b> or <b>MagicMaster -check-db MI-DB-Weapons</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including <i>\'MI-DB-Weapons\'</i>, as long as the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields are correctly defined. Use the parameter <i>\'MI-DB-Ammo\'</i> to check and update the ammunition databases.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<p>Here are some examples:</p>'

The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the APIs are those highlighted.  Each of these elements are inserted <i>between</i> the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.

							+'<h3>Making a 1-Handed Weapon able to be 2-Handed</h3>'
							+'<p>Generally, it is not worth wielding the average 1-Handed weapon with both hands - you gain no advantage and lose use of the other hand. Clearly, there are some exceptions like a Basterd Sword which is designed to be used as either 1-handed or 2-handed and gains extra damage from doing so.</p>'
							+'<b>However:</b> certain 1-handed weapons gain benefits when a character has proficiency in the <i>Two-Hander Fighting Style</i>, and perhaps with other (custom) fighting styles the DM chooses to set up. However, those without these proficiencies should not gain benefit from 2-handed use of these weapons. To achieve this outcome, these weapons need to be specified in a particular fashion in the Weapons Database.  Here is an example:</p>'

							+'<p>Here it can be seen that there are two data sets specified for the <i>Specs</i> field and only one data set specified for the <i>ToHitData</i>. Doing this tells the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but generally will not gain any different advantages. If a Character is proficient or specialised in Two-Hander Fighting Style, however, the APIs will see that this is a 1-handed weapon held in both hands, and allocate it the correct benefits. But only certain weapons gain these benefits, so only certain weapons in the database should be set up this way.</p>'

							+'<p>As previously stated and as per the weapon and ammunition databases, each armour definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): the Ability Macro, the ct- attribute, and the listing (and occasionally attributes for powers and spells).  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract to the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after examination and use the --check-db command to re-index the databases).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b>The DM creating new armour entries does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>!attk --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> or <b>!magic --check-db MI-DB-Armour</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including \'MI-DB-Armour\', as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'

							+'<h1>Spell, Power & Magic Item Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for MagicMaster v'+version+' and later</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The MagicMaster API uses a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining spells, powers and magic items and their effects.  The databases are distributed in the game-version-specific <b>RPGMasther Library</b> with many spell, power & magic item definitions.  DMs can add their own weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each Character Sheet database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the Magic Master API;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items;</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Magic Items - see MI entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining spell, power and magic item ability macros.  When a Player or an NPC or Creature views or casts a spell, power or uses a magic item the Magic Master API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<p>When a Character, NPC or Creature views or uses an item, or views or casts a spell or power, the system searches the relevant databases for an item, spell or power with the selected name, and copies any database ability macro so found to the Character Sheet of the Character, NPC or Creature - if it already exists it will overwrite it with the latest version. If the system can\'t find a matching entry in any of the databases, API supplied or GM created, it then searches the Character Sheet for a matching ability macro previously saved there - this caters for the character/NPC/creature being moved to a new campaign that, for instance, does not hold a particular GM-created database item, as the macros the Character Sheet needs are always held on it.</p>'
							+'<p>Whenever a new gameplay session is started, or the <b>--check-db</b> command is run, the system indexes all database items, both those in API memory and those held in Character Sheet databases: Character Sheet database items in user-defined databases take preference over API databases extracted to Character Sheet databases, which in turn take preference over API databases held in memory.  This index speeds up access to the database items. However, items in Character Sheet databases are still much slower for the system to access than items in the API databases in memory. Thus it is best not to use extracted API databases in live gameplay, but only for copying items to support development of GM-created items in a GM\'s own databases. After use, the extracted API databases can just be deleted.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Spells & Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any spell or item provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Spells and Powers Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Spells/Powers databases have names that start with</p>'
							+'<p>	<b>Wizard Spells:</b>	MU-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Priest Spells:</b>	PR-Spells-DB-[added name]<br>'
							+'	<b>Powers:</b>			Powers-DB-[added name]</p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each spell or power definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the spell or power, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same level in the spell book of the level of the spell or power.  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases using the <b>!magic --extract-db</b> command, and take a look (but remember to delete it after viewing to speed things up, and then reindex the databases using <b>!magic --check-db</b>)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new spells and powers does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'

							+'<p>The ability specification for this Sleep spell uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case provided by the RPGMaster Library (see the documentation for the RPGMaster Library for specifications of this Roll Template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the MagicMaster API are those highlighted.  In red, two API buttons grant the player access to run RoundMaster API commands to show the Area of Effect of the spell, and then to mark affected tokens with a "Sleepy" status.</p>'
							+'Each of the elements important to the database are inserted between the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.

Multiply the number of Rounds it will take to cast by 10, or the number of Turns it will take to cast by 100 (if using the <b>InitMaster API</b> the rounds will be automatically counted down and the spell actually cast in the appropriate round, unless the casting is interrupted).  It can also be a dice roll specification, which will be rolled at the point that a character selects the spell, power or item to use in a particular round, which means the speed can vary from round to round.  E.g. under AD&D2e rules, potions are always of this nature (see the AD&D2e DMG p141).</p>'
							+'<p>The cost of material components, <b>gp:</b>, is deducted from the Caster\'s money on their Character Sheet each time the spell is cast.  The GM is informed of the spell being cast, by whom, and how much money it cost and how much money the Caster has left for each casting.</p>'

							+'<p>In this case, there are multiple repeating datasets in each data section: there are three possible variants of the Spiritual Hammer depending on the caster\'s level.

These spell slots should not be used by characters in your campaign.  If they are, errors might occur.  By default, on the AD&D2E character sheet the system uses Wizard Level 14 spell slots for magic item powers, and Wizard Level 15 spell slots for spell-storing magic items.  As standard AD&D2E only has spells up to level 9 this generally works without causing problems.</p>'
							+'<p>Next, in addition to the three standard elements of the Ability Macro, the \'ct-\' attribute and the listing, these items require a 4th element which specifies their powers and spells.  These are:</p>'

							+'<h1>Character Class & Race Databases</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for RPGMaster APIs</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining races, creatures, character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Races & Creatures:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views or casts a spell, power or uses a magic item the Magic Master API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Races, Classes, Spells & Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. Character Class Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The DM can add Character Class databases as character sheets that have names that start with Class-DB. The Class definitions that come with the installed game-version-specific <b>RPGMaster Library</b> can be extracted to a character sheet and viewed by using the <i><b>!magic --extract-db Class-DB</b> or <b>!attk --extract-db Class-DB</b></i> commands.  <b>Note:</b> it is best to delete the extracted Class-DB database character sheet after viewing/using, so that the system uses the much faster internal database version. After deleting or changing any character sheet database, always run the <i><b>!magic --check-db</b> or <b>!attk --check-db</b></i> command to re-index the databases.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Classes:</b>	Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i></p>'
							+'<p>Those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each class definition has 3 parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the Class being defined, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", and a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with others of the same base class: the base classes being "Warrior", "Wizard", "Priest", "Rogue", and "Psion".  The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root database using the <b><i>--extract-db</i></b> command and take a look (remember to delete it after viewing - see above)</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new classes does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases, as long as the Specs and Data fields in the Ability Macros are correctly defined. Use the name of the particular database as a parameter to check and update just that database.  Running the command <b><i>--check-db</i></b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'

							+'<h1>Attacks Database</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for RPGMaster APIs</i></h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Macros defining character classes, spells, powers and magic items and their effects. Previous versions of the RPGMaster series of APIs held their databases all externally as character sheets: from this version onwards this is not the case for databases supplied with the APIs, which are now held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. The APIs are distributed with many class, spell, power & magic item definitions, and DMs can add their own character classes, spells, items, weapons, ammo and armour to additional databases in their own database character sheets, with new definitions for database items held in Ability Macros. Additional database character sheets should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Wizard Spells:</th><td>additional databases: MU-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Priest Spells:</th><td>additional databases: PR-Spells-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Powers:</th><td>additional databases: Powers-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Magic Items:</th><td>additional databases: MI-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Classes:</th><td>additional databases: Class-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Character Races:</th><td>additional databases: Race-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Attack Calculations:</th><td>additional databases: Attacks-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'	<tr><th scope="row">Fighting Styles:</th><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-<i>[added name]</i> where <i>[added name]</i> can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr>'
							+'</table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. MI-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want. Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p>Each added database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul>'
							+'	<li>Ability Macros named as the class, spell, power or magic item specified, and used to describe and provide effects for classes, spells, powers and magic items using the commands in the RPGMaster APIs;</li>'
							+'	<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the casting time and casting cost for spells & powers, and speed and MI type for magic items (not currently used for Class or Attack definitions);</li>'
							+'	<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (Spell Level of the spell defined, Powers tab, or various spell books for different Classes & Magic Items - see Class entry below).</li>'
							+'</ul>'
							+'<p>However, as with all other Databases in the RPGMaster Suite of APIs, if the <i>Ability Macros</i> are correctly set up using the formats detailed in the Help Documentation, the <b>AttackMaster API</b> command <b>!attk --check-db database-name</b> will check the database and set up all other aspects for you, including the correct Custom Attributes and List entries.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired. Roll Templates are very useful when defining class, spell, power and magic item ability macros, and are an essential part of Attack Templates.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster makes an attack, the AttackMaster API runs the relevant Ability Macro from the databases as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Database Items</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any Ability Macro provided in any of the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases (a database with the same root name) with the Ability Macro you create having exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>2. How Attacks Work</h2>'
							+'<p>In order to understand the Attacks Database, it is first important to understand how attacks are executed by the <b>AttackMaster API</b>.  Under some (if not all) versions of D&D, and especially <i>AD&D 2nd Edition</i>, attacks are quite complex involving many factors that can vary from moment to moment.  Some say that this is why they prefer RPG systems that require less maths and are faster to execute, that the complexity of the AD&D2e combat system interrupts the flow of play.  The AttackMaster API handles attacks in such a way as to hide as much of that complexity from the players as possible, and thus allow game-play to flow and players to concentrate on the unfolding story.</p>'
							+'<p>In order for the API to achieve this, it must evaluate many factors "on the fly" such as current magical effects in place (generally or on individuals), the current attributes of a character (which can vary as they are affected by game play), the type, range and properties of the weapon combinations used at that point in time for that particular attack, and the effects of the race, class, level and proficiency of the character, among several others.  Given that these factors can vary even during a single round, each attack must be fully evaluated from scratch each time it is made.</p>'
							+'<p>Another issue is introduced by players feeling much more satisfied if they can see dice rolling for the attack, or they may want to use the Roll20 dice rolling mouse action, or even their own physical dice.  Unfortunately for API authors, at the time of writing the API it is only possible to display rolling 3D dice from Chat Window dice rolls, either typed in the entry box by the player or run from Macros displayed in the Chat Window - 3D dice will not work when called by or included in API calls and commands.</p>'
							+'<p>So how does the AttackMaster API achieve 3D dice rolls and attack calculations that can accelerate game-play?  The answer is that it uses Attack Template definitions which it parses and turns into Ability Macros on the Character Sheet of the character that selects to do an attack.  The Melee Weapon templates are parsed and the attack Ability Macros for each Melee weapon in-hand created on the Character Sheet as (in fact just before) the Attack chat window menu is displayed, and Ranged Weapon templates are parsed and their attack Ability Macros are created after the type of Ammo has been selected and just before the relevant range buttons on the Attack menu are enabled for the Player to select.  Monster attack templates are parsed just before the Monster Attack menu is shown, with a template "set" created for each defined Monster <i>innate</i> attack on the Monster character sheet tab.  When the Player selects a Melee weapon to attack with, or the relevant range button for a Ranged weapon or Monster attack, the API is then not actually involved at all - the Roll20 Chat Window button just selected is just doing a standard macro call to the relevant attack Ability Macro just created on the Character Sheet.  This also means the actual attacks happen at the fastest speed Roll20 can achieve as no API code is being run at that point.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>3. The Attacks Database</h2>'
							+'<p>The Attack Templates are stored in the internal API Attacks Database, which can be exposed in Character Sheet Database form as <i>Attacks-DB</i> using the AttackMaster <b>!attk --extract-DB Attacks-DB</b> command. Attack Templates can also exist in additional bespoke Attacks Databases the DM/Game Creator adds using the Character Sheet name <i>Attacks-DB-[added name]</i>.  There are 12 basic Attack Templates:</p>'
							+'<table>'

							+'</table>'
							+'<p>The Melee Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each Melee Weapon in-hand at the time of the attack, and the Ranged Weapon Attack Templates will be parsed for each possible range of the Ranged Weapon/Ammo combination selected for the attack.  Two additional Melee Weapon Attack Templates are parsed if the character making the attack is a Rogue class:</p>'

							+'</table>'
							+'<p>All of the above templates are provided in the Attacks-DB database supplied with the game version-specific RPGMaster Library API.  They are created to follow the rules of the game version supported by that specific library: DMs and Game Creators can create their own attack and damage calculations following whatever rules they want in their own bespoke Attacks Database, using the information provided in the next section.</p>'
							+'<p>It is possible to add additional Attack Templates that are specific to particular Races, Classes, or even individual weapons!  Indeed, the database supplied includes an example of a bespoke Attack Template set for a thrown prepared Oil Flask.  When an attack is the action selected by the Player, the API will search the Attacks-DB and bespoke user Attacks Databases for Melee and Ranged Attack Templates in the following name order (replace the ?W with either MW or RW as appropriate):</p>'
							+'<ol>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< weapon name \> </b> Searches for a weapon-specific Attack Template set for the weapon being used to attack with, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< class name \> </b> Searches for a class-specific Attack Template set for the class (or each class of a multi/dual class) of the attacking character, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit-\< race \> </b> Searches for a race-specific Attack Template set for the race of the attacking character, but if not found then</li>'
							+'	<li><b>?W-ToHit</b> Uses the default Attack Template set.</li>'
							+'</ol>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>4. Attack Data Fields</h2>'
							+'<p>Attack Templates can take the form of any message or macro that can be held in a Roll20 Character Sheet Ability Macro and be displayed in the Chat Window when called.  Typically, this will use a Roll Template (standard Roll20 functionality - see Roll20 Help for information), but it can be any format you desire as long as it results in the correct display of information to the Player.</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template has a large number of template fields that it can call upon to use in its calculations - these are pre-calculated values supplied by the API that the DM / Game Creator writing a new Attack Template can use.  The standard Roll20 attribute value notation of @{selected|field-name} is not recommended for use in Attack Templates, as when the template is parsed, and then later the resulting Ability Macro run as part of the attack, there are circumstances where the token for the attacking Character may not be currently selected, resulting in the wrong value being used or, worse, an error occurring and the game halting.  Instead, all the following template fields are available:</p>'

							+'<h2>5. Character (PC & NPC) Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>As previously described, the Attacks Database contains Attack Templates as Ability Macro entries.  For Characters and NPCs that attack using weapons "in-hand" (see AttackMaster API documentation for information on taking weapons "in-hand"), four standard Attack Templates are required: -ToHit; -DmgSM; -DmgL; and -Targeted-Attk.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.1 The "To Hit" Template</h3>'
							+'<p>A standard <i>To Hit</i> Attack Template looks like this (the example is for the AD&D2e version):</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-ToHit</h4>'

							+'<p>The four fields in the <i>Specs</i> data are the standard four used in all Specs fields: Entry Type (MWtoHit), Entry Class (AttackMacro), Handedness (in this case replaced by toHit dice roll spec 1d20), and Entry Supertype (Attack).  The key field to note here is the <b>ToHit Dice Roll Specification</b> (which replaces the <i>Handedness</i> field).  This can be any valid dice roll, and will be used for the <i>^^toHitRoll^^</i> template field if the Player selects Roll20 to roll the attack dice.</p>'
							+'<p>This Attack Template is formatted using a Roll20 Roll Template with a type specified using the <i>^^defaultTemplate^^</i> template field, but need not be - formatting is up to the creator of the Attack Template.  It is important this information is displayed to the right people - Players that control a character, all Players as a public post, or just the DM for attacks by creatures & NPCs.  The <i>^^toWhoPublic^^</i> template field will check if the attacking token represents a Character/NPC/Creature controlled by a Player and, if so, make a public post that all can see, but otherwise just whisper the results of the attack to the DM only.  Similarly, <i>^^toWho^^</i> will whisper the attack information either only to the Player(s) that control the attacking character/creature or, if no one does, then to the DM.</p>'
							+'<p>The rest of the Attack Template defines the calculations using the API supplied data to display the Armour Class value that would be successfully hit by the attacking character, with the selected weapon under the current conditions.  It also defines a display of the adjustments that are made to the dice roll which the Players and DM can hover a mouse over to get an explanation of the calculations.  All the calculations and tag display are standard Roll20 functionality, so once the Attack Template Data Fields are replaced by actual values by the API and the resulting Ability Macro saved to the attacking character\'s Character Sheet, running it like any other Ability Macro will use only Roll20 functionality, and not involve use of the APIs (unless the Attack template specifically includes an API call).</p>'
							+'<p>The Attack Template shown above is a To Hit template for a <b><i>Melee weapon</i></b> attack.  That for a <b><i>Ranged weapon</i></b> attack is very similar, just using some different and ranged attack related Template Fields.</p>'
							+'<h3>5.2 The "Damage" Templates</h3>'
							+'<p>There are always two damage Attack Templates to go with each <i>To Hit</i> Template, typically one for damage to Medium and smaller opponents and one for Large and larger.  However, as will be seen when discussing the <i>Oil Flask</i> bespoke Attack Templates below, those are not always the outcomes of the two damage Templates.  However, they <i>do</i> always start with MW-DmgSM and MW-DmgL for Melee weapon attacks, and RW-DmgSM and RW-DmgL for Ranged weapon attacks (optionally followed by a race, class or weapon name). The standard <i>Damage</i> Attack Template looks like this:</p>'
							+'<h4>MW-DmgSM</h4>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> does damage with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{Subtitle=Melee Attack}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[MWtoHit,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=@{<b>^^cname^^</b>|ac-hit}}}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ ([[<b>^^weapDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice Roll]) + ([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^weapStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+]) + ([[<b>^^weapDmgAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^weapStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg adj]) + ([[<b>^^specProf^^</b>*2]][Specialist+] + [[<b>^^masterProf^^</b>*3]][Mastery+])]]}}{{Dmg L=[Roll](~<b>^^mwLHdmgMacro^^</b>)}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}</p>'
							+'<p>The damage Attack Template works in the same way as the other Attack Templates as explained above for the <i>ToHit</i> template.  While the <i>Specs</i> data includes the "To Hit" dice roll specification, this is not used in the damage Template, and is irrelevant.  That field just needs to hold something, and a dice roll specification is what is expected.  Hopefully, the rest of this damage Attack Template is self explanatory.</p>'
							+'<h2>6. Monster Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>If a creature specified as a Monster on the Character Sheet uses in-hand weapons, as supported under the RPGMaster APIs, attacks with those weapons (Melee or Ranged) will use the standard <i>To Hit</i> and <i>Damage</i> Attack Templates described above.  However, attacks by creatures that are specified as Monsters (e.g. on the Monster tab of the Advanced 2nd Edition character sheet) are generally much simpler than character attacks with in-hand weapons.  The differences mean that such creatures require different Attack Templates.  Attacks specified on the Monster tab use the Monster Attack Templates: Mon-Attk, Mon-DmgSM, and Mon-DmgL (or the Targeted Attack Templates, see later).  Remember that the AttackMaster API supports an extension of the Monster Attk fields on the Advanced 2nd Edition Character Sheet: each can contain a comma-separated list consisting of "attack name","dice roll","speed in segments","damage type" (see AttackMaster Help for details).</p>'

							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>7. Targeted Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>The AttackMaster API supports the DM (and optionally, Players) using "targeted attacks".  This is an attack that prompts the DM / Player to select a target token, and then performs all attack and damage dice rolls at the same time, displaying the attack results alongside the Armour Class and relative health of the targeted opponent.  This speeds the attack process even further than having the API do all the attack calculations.  <b>Note:</b> the results of the attack <i>are not</i> applied to the targeted opponent - the results are still open to interpretation by the Players and DM, and circumstantial adjustment before manually applying them to the Token / Character Sheet of the opponent.</p>'
							+'<p>The Ranged weapon Targeted Attack Template for AD&D2e (for example) looks like this:</p>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;"><b>^^toWhoPublic^^</b> &{template:<b>^^defaultTemplate^^</b>}{{title=<b>^^tname^^</b> attacks @{Target|Select Target|Token_name} with their <b>^^weapon^^</b>}}{{subtitle=Ranged Attack &#42; **Ammo Left: <b>^^ammoLeft^^</b>**}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[RWtargetedAttk,AttackMacro,1d20,Attack]</mark>{{AC Hit=[[([[<b>^^thac0^^</b>]][Thac0])-(([[<b>^^weapAttkAdj^^</b>]][Weapon+]) + ([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+]) + ([[<b>^^weapStyleAdj^^</b>]][Style+]) + ([[ <b>^^weapDexBonus^^</b>*[[<b>^^dexMissile^^</b>]]]][Dexterity+] )+([[[[<b>^^strAttkBonus^^</b>]]*[[<b>^^weapStrHit^^</b>]]]][Strength+])+([[<b>^^raceBonus^^</b>]][Race mod])+([[<b>^^profPenalty^^</b>]][Prof penalty])+([[<b>^^magicAttkAdj^^</b>]][Magic Hit+])+([[<b>^^twoWeapPenalty^^</b>]][2-weap penalty])+([[<b>^^rangeMod^^</b>]][Range mod]))-([[<b>^^toHitRoll^^</b>cs\><b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>cf\<<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>]][Dice roll]) ]] }}{{Attk Type=<b>^^weapType^^</b>}}{{Target AC=<b>^^targetACmissile^^</b>}}{{Target SAC=<b>^^ACvsSlashMissile^^</b>}}{{Target PAC=<b>^^ACvsPierceMissile^^</b>}}{{Target BAC=<b>^^ACvsBludgeonMissile^^</b>}}{{Dmg S=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(^^rangeN^^*0.5)+(^^rangePB^^*(1+^^masterProfPB^^))+(^^rangeSMLF^^*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgSM^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Dmg L=[[ floor( ([[<b>^^ammoDmgSM^^</b>]][Dice roll]) * ([[(<b>^^rangeN^^</b>*0.5)+(<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*(1+<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>))+(<b>^^rangeSMLF^^</b>*1)]][Range mult])) + ([[<b>^^rangePB^^</b>*<b>^^masterProfPB^^</b>*2]][Range mod]) + (([[<b>^^ammoDmgAdj^^</b>]][Ammo+])+([[<b>^^ammoStyleDmgAdj^^</b>+<b>^^ammoStyleDmgL^^</b>]][Style+])+([[<b>^^magicDmgAdj^^</b>]][Magic dmg+]) +([[<b>^^strDmgBonus^^</b>*<b>^^ammoStrDmg^^</b>]][Strength+])) ]]}}{{Target HP=^<b>^targetHP^^</b>}}{{Target MaxHP=<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Target Heart=<b>^^targetHP^^</b>/<b>^^targetMaxHP^^</b>}}{{Crit Roll=<b>^^weapCritHit^^</b>}}{{Fumble Roll=<b>^^weapCritMiss^^</b>}}{{Result=AC Hit\<=Target AC}}</p>'
							+'<p>The key difference, other than doing all of the calculations for the Armour Class hit and both the damage for Medium and smaller and Large and larger, is that several of the Template Fields used resolve to appropriately formatted Roll20 <i>@{target|...}</i> entries, that will display values from the targeted opponent\'s token and/or character sheet.  The API searches for the most appropriate token and character sheet fields to resolve the targeted Template Fields to (it searches the attacking creature\'s data, and assumes all tokens are set up the same way): if using the standard RPGMaster token settings (as set by the <b>CommandMaster API --abilities</b> command or [Token Setup] DM\'s Macro button) it will find the data it needs on the token; otherwise it will first search other token fields, then standard Character Sheet character tab fields, then Character Sheet monster tab fields.  If the API can\'t find AC or HP data, it will display appropriate text saying the data was not found, but will not cause an error.  Thus it is sensible to use these Template Fields rather than statically defined <i>@{target|...}</i> commands.</p>'
							+'<br>'
							+'<h2>8. Bespoke / Custom Attack Templates</h2>'
							+'<p>All of the above examples and discussion have explored the standard Attack Templates distributed with the AttackMaster API.  It will be the case that this will cater for around 95% of attacks and attack-like situations (e.g. there is a weapon called "Touch" which Spell Casters can use for touch-attack spells, which uses the standard Attack Templates without change to achieve the needed outcome).  However, for that other 5% (or perhaps closer to 1%) of special cases you can define your own bespoke or custom Attack Templates.  Being able to change the way attacks are calculated is also essential if you wish to adapt the API to work for game systems other than those for which RPGMaster Library rulesets currently exist.</p>'
							+'<p>As stated in Section 1, you <i>should not</i> add Attack Templates to the <i>Attacks-DB</i> database directly. Instead, create your own Character Sheet named <i>Attack-DB-[any-name-you-want]</i> and add Attack Templates to it. If you want to replace the Attack Templates provided for Melee weapons, Ranged weapons and/or Monster attacks, just create ones in your added database with the same Ability Macro name and they will automatically be used in preference to the standard versions.</p>'
							+'<p>As also mentioned previously, while Attack Templates are always called with names of the format given in Section 3, they do not have to result in standard attacks or damage - the calculations and resulting information provided to players can be whatever is needed as a result of that attack action.  An example of this is included in the distributed <i>Attacks-DB</i>, the <b>Oil Flask Attack Template set</b>:</p>'

							+'<h1>Fighting Styles Database</h1>'
							+'<h6><i>for AttackMaster v1.3.05</i> and later</h6>'
							+'<h2>1. General Database information</h2>'
							+'<p>The RPGMaster APIs use a number of databases to hold Ability Macros defining rules, conditions and benefits of various styles of fighting with weapons and shields, defined in the RPGMaster Library for various game versions. Databases supplied with the APIs are held internally to the APIs. However, the AttackMaster or MagicMaster API command <b>--extract-db</b> can be used to extract any or all standard databases to Character Sheets for examination and update. DMs can add their own fighting style definitions to additional databases held as Character Sheets. Additional databases should be named as follows:</p>'
							+'<table><tr><td>Fighting Styles:</td><td>additional databases: Styles-DB-[added name] where [added name] can be replaced with anything you want.</td></tr></table>'
							+'<p><b>However:</b> the system will ignore any database with a name that includes a version number of the form "v#.#" where # can be any number or group of numbers e.g. Styles-DB v2.13 will be ignored.  This is so that the DM can version control their databases, with only the current one (without a version number) being live.</p>'
							+'<p>There can be as many additional databases as you want.  Other Master series APIs come with additional databases, some of which overlap - this does not cause a problem as version control and merging unique macros is managed by the APIs.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> all Character Sheet databases <b><u><i>must</i></u></b> have their <i>\'ControlledBy\'</i> value (found under the [Edit] button at the top right of each sheet) set to <i>\'All Players\'</i>.  This must be for all databases, both those provided (set by the API) and any user-defined ones.  Otherwise, Players will not be able to run the macros contained in them.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Important Note:</b> databases extracted using the <b>--extract-db</b> command will be able to be edited, but will also slow the system down - the versions held internally in the APIs are much faster for the system to access. Once any extracted database has been examined, it is best to delete them and use the <b>--check-db</b> to re-index the databases so the system operates as fast as possible.</p>'
							+'<p>Each database has a similar structure, with:</p>'
							+'<ul><li>Ability Macros named as the fighting style specified, and used to describe and provide specifications for using the commands with the AttackMaster API;</li>'
							+'<li>Custom Attributes with the attribute name "ct-ability-macro-name", one per Ability Macro, which defines the speed and type for each item;</li>'
							+'<li>An entry in a list on the character sheet in the spell book of the relevant Character Sheet tab (various spell books for different items - see entry below);</li>'
							+'<li>Optionally, some entries come also with attributes that define Powers and Spells delivered by or stored on the item (irrelevant for fighting styles).</li></ul>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> a DM only needs to program the Ability Macro using the formats shown in the next section, and then run the <b>!attk --check-db</b> or <b>!magic --check-db</b> command, which will correctly parse the ability macro and set the rest of the database entries as needed.</p>'
							+'<p>Ability Macros can be whatever the DM wants and can be as simple or as complex as desired, as long as they include the required information specified below. Roll Templates are very useful when defining ability macros - the RPGMaster Library provides several new Roll Templates that do not rely on any particular Character Sheet: <i>RPGMdefault</i> is the most relevant. See the RPGMaster Library help handout for further information.  When a Player or an NPC or Monster views the specifications of a fighting style the APIs run the relevant Ability Macro from the database as if it had been run by the Player from the chat window.  All Roll20 functions for macros are available.</p>'
							+'<h3>1.1 Replacing Provided Styles</h3>'
							+'<p>If you want to replace any style provided in the databases, you can do so simply by creating an Ability Macro in one of your own databases with exactly the same name as the provided item to be replaced.  The API gives preference to Ability Macros in user-defined databases, so yours will be selected in preference to the one provided with the APIs.</p>'
							+'<h2>2. Fighting Style Databases</h2>'
							+'<p>Fighting style databases have names that start with Styles-DB, and can have anything put at the end, though those with version numbers of the form v#.# as part of the name will be ignored.</p>'
							+'<p>As previously stated, each style definition has 3 (or 4) parts in the database (see Section 1): an Ability Macro with a name that is unique and matches the style, an Attribute with the name of the Ability Macro preceded by "ct-", a listing in the database character sheet of the ability macro name separated by \'|\' along with other fighting styles. The quickest way to understand these entries is to examine existing entries.  Do extract the root databases and take a look (but remember to delete them after exploring the items in them, so as not to slow the system down unnecessarily).</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> The DM creating new weapons does not need to worry about anything other than the Ability Macro in the database, as running the <b>AttackMaster</b> or <b>MagicMaster -check-db Styles-DB</b> command will update all other aspects of the database appropriately for all databases that have a name starting with or including <i>\'Styles-DB\'</i>, as long as the <i>Specs</i> and <i>Data</i> fields are correctly defined.  Running the command <b>-check-db</b> with no parameters will check and update all databases.</p>'
							+'<p>The Styles-DB database provided with the APIs contains standard definitions for the four fighting styles defined in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, plus a couple of other examples for Ranged weapons to demonstrate how other styles can be defined.  After extracting the provided Styles database or creating your own as discussed above, aAbility macros can be added to a database just by using the [+Add] button at the top of the Abilities column in the Attributes and Abilities tab of the Database Character Sheet, and then using the edit "pencil" icon on the new entry to open it for editing.  Ability macros are standard Roll20 functionality and not dependent on the API.  Refer to the Roll20 Help Centre for more information.</p>'
							+'<p>Here is an example:</p>'

							+'One great advantage to this style is that you always have another weapon in hand if you drop or lose one. A single Disarm maneuver cannot rid you of your weapons.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'The principal disadvantage to this style, as with some other styles, is that you don\'t gain the AC benefit of a shield.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'Please read the "Attacking with Two Weapons" section from the Player\'s Handbook, page 96, before continuing.<br>'
							+'If you devote a weapon proficiency slot to style specialization with Two-Weapon Style, you get two important benefits. First, your attack penalty drops; before, it was a –2 with your primary weapon and –4 with your secondary, but with Specialization in Two-Weapon Style it becomes 0 with your primary weapon and a –2 with your secondary weapon. (If you\'re already ambidextrous, that penalty is 0 with primary weapon and 0 with secondary weapon). Second, you\'re allowed to use weapons of the same length in each hand, so you can, for example, wield two long swords.<br>'
							+'When fighting with two-weapon technique, you can choose for both weapons to try the same maneuver (for example, two strikes, or two disarms), or can have each try a different maneuver (one strike and one parry, one pin and one strike). If the two maneuvers are to be different, each receives a –1 attack penalty.<br>'
							+'Though rangers don\'t suffer the off-hand penalties for two-weapons use, they do not get a bonus to attack rolls if they devote a weapon proficiency slot to Two-Weapon Style. They do get the other benefit, of being able to use weapons of equal length.}}</p>'
							+'<p>The ability specification for the Weapon & Shield Fighting Style uses a Roll20 Roll Template, in this case defined in the RPGMaster Library (see the help handout for the Library to review the specifications of this template), but any Roll Template you desire can be used.  The entries in the Roll Template itself can be anything you desire, giving as much or as little information as you want.  However, the important elements for the APIs are those highlighted.  Each of these elements are inserted <i>between</i> the elements of the Roll Template, meaning they will not be seen by the player when the macro is run.  Generally spaces, hyphens and underscores in the data elements are ignored, and case is not significant.  Each element is described below:</p>'

							+'<br>'
							+'<p>Here is another example showing how the keys <i>oneh</i> and <i>twoh</i> are used in combination with other keys to implement the Two-Hander Style:</p>'
							+'<h3>Two-Hander Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Two Hander Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Two Hander,Style,2H,Melee-style]</mark>{{desc=Two-Hander Style involves carrying and wielding a weapon with both hands. Naturally, many weapons (including polearms, the great axe, the two-handed sword, and others) require two-handed technique. Other weapons (such as bastard sword, javelin, and spear) have it as a listed option.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of two-handed weapon technique is that it allows the character to wield large two-handed weapons which can do substantial amounts of damage. <br>'
							+'A second advantage is that, if you are using a two-handed weapon, the Disarm maneuver is only of partial use against you. A single successful Disarm against a two-handed weapon user won\'t knock the weapon out of the wielder\'s hands; it will merely knock his weapon askew and make him take some time to recover, so he automatically loses initiative on his next round. However, two Disarm maneuvers successfully made against the character in the same round will knock the weapon loose.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with single-weapon use, two-handed weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Two-Hander Style gives you a very specific benefit: When you\'re using a weapon two-handed, that weapon\'s Speed Factor is reduced by 3.<br>'
							+'This is because when a fighter wields such a weapon with both hands on the hilt, he has more leverage on the blade and can move it faster. That\'s what Style Specialization in Two-Hander Style will do for the character: It teaches him how to use the weapon much faster and more aggressively than someone with less specialized training in the weapon.}}{{desc4=**One-Handed Weapons Used Two-Handed**<br>'
							+'Some players don\'t realize that many other one-handed weapons can also be used two-handed. If you specialize in Two-Hander Style and then use a one-handed weapon in two hands, you also get a bonus of +1 to damage. The one-handed weapons which can be used two-handed in this fashion include: Battle axe, Club, Footman\'s flail, Footman\'s pick, Horseman\'s flail, Horseman\'s mace, Horseman\'s pick, Morning star, Long sword, Warhammer.}}</p>'
							+'<p>Here the data specification is:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:melee, weaps:any],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3],[1H:dmg=+1, 2H:mwsp=-3]</pre>'
							+'<p>This specifies that there must be a melee weapon equipped in the [Both Hands] slot, and if this is a two-handed weapon then the melee weapon speed is improved by 3 segments.  However, if the weapon in the [Both Hands] slot is one of the few one-handed weapons allowed to be taken in both hands (as defined in The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook for this style), then instead it will gain +1 to the damage it inflicts. In this case, the same benefits apply whether the character is just proficient or specialist in the Two-Hander Style.</p>'
							+'<p><b>Note:</b> only cetain one-handed weapons can be taken in both hands. Indeed, only certain one-handd weapons will appear in the weapon list shown when the [Both Hands] button is selected on the <i>Change Weapon</i> menu. This is achieved in the weapon specifications in the Weapons Database. For full details, see the explanation given in the <i>Weapons & Armour Database Help</i> handout. In summary, a one-handed weapon which can be wielded two-handed and gain Two-Hander Fighting Style benefits, such as a Battle Axe, requires a second <i>Specs</i> dataset with the \'2H\' attribute, but <b><i>no additional ToHitData datasets.</i></b>  This informs the APIs that this weapon can be taken in both hands, but will not gain any benefits from doing so (unlike, e.g. a Bastard Sword) unless the Character has proficiency in the Two-Hander Fighting Style.</p>'
							+'<p>Other styles can be defined that are not specified in <i>The Complete Fighter\'s Handbook</i>, and some examples are provided in the distributed database:</p>'
							+'<h3>Bowyer Style</h3>'
							+'<p style="display: inline-block; background-color: lightgrey; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px; color: dimgrey; font-weight: extra-light;">&{template:RPGMdefault}{{name=Bowyer Fighting Style}}<mark style="color:green">Specs=[Bowyer,Style,2H,Ranged-style]</mark>{{desc=Bowyer Fighting Style reflects fighters who practice day in, day out at the range perfecting their use of bows of all types.}}<mark style="color:blue">StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</mark>{{desc1=**Advantages**<br>'
							+'The main advantage of bowyer technique is that it allows the character to wield two-handed bows which can do damage at long ranges, staying out of melee and making you a difficult enemy to attack.}}{{desc2=**Disadvantages**<br>'
							+'As with any two-handed weapon use use, bowyer weapon technique has the drawback that the user cannot wear or use a shield, or gain the shield\'s AC bonus.}}{{desc3=**Style Specialization**<br>'
							+'You can, by devoting a weapon proficiency to it, take a Style Specialization with Bowyer Style.<br>'
							+'Style Specialization with Bowyer Style enables you to extend your accuracy at range by 10 yards at short range, 20 at medium and 30 at long range, and improve the speed of the bow by 2 segments. As their skill improves further (by dedicating two proficiency slots), range increases further (by 30 yards at medium and 50 at long), and nocking arrows and drawing the bow faster to enable them to get additional attack every other round}}</p>'
							+'<p>This style has a slightly more complex data specification:</p>'
							+'<pre>StyleData=[twohand:ranged, weaps:bow],[rwr:+1/+1/+2/+3,rwsp:-2],[rwr:+1/+1/+3/+5,rwsp:-3,rwn:+1/2]</pre>'
							+'<p>You can see here the application of the restriction of this fighting style to two-handed ranged weapons that belong to the weapon group <i>bow</i>, then applying benefits using the range extension key <i>rwr</i>, the ranged weapon speed modifier <i>rwsp</i>, and improving the number of attacks for a ranged weapon by one attack per two rounds using <i>rwn</i>.</p>'
							+'<p>A wide range of fighting styles can be created using the different combination of rules and benefits, to enrich the game you create, and your players experience.  If you need help or guidance, or experience any issues, do access the RPGMaster forum on Roll20 - search the wiki for the link, or navigate via the Community Forums to the API / Mods forum and search for RPGMaster.</p>'
